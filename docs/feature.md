- Make the museum experience like playing through a game

Ask a series of story based questions along through the user journey (before the user starts the museum virtual tour as well as after the user finishes playing through a scene) such that we can generate a personalised order of scenes for that user to experience all based on his own choice.

For example, we ask "You are a tourist coming to the Earth from XXX nebula to enjoy your holiday, unfortunately, the engine of your spaceship got a bit out of order and took you to the Earth 1 million years ago. You found that this planet only has volcanoes and oceans on it. You need to land your spaceship and fix the engine. Where do you want to land?" If the user chooses 'Volcano', then we brings him to the Volcano scene.
